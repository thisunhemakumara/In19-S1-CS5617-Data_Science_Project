## Research question to be explored or hypothesis to be validated

We formulated some hypothesis as mentioned below based on the above datasets that we have selected.

To test if there is any correlation exists between the departure for foreign employment of the unskilled workers and housemaids and the total paddy production of Sri Lanka in both Yala and Maha seasons.

The hypothesis that we are trying to test can be represented as follows.

H0 : Correlation coefficient between departure of the unskilled workers for the foreign employment and the total paddy production = 0

H1: Correlation coefficient between departure of the unskilled workers for the foreign employment and the total paddy production <> 0
	
Further to test if there is any correlation exists between the real daily wages(carries annual inflation rates) of Informal sector and the departure of the unskilled workers(Agriculture and Housing construction sectors) for foreign employment.

The hypothesis that we are trying to test can be represented as follows.

H0 :  Correlation coefficient between departure of the unskilled workers for foreign Employment and daily wages of Informal sector = 0

H1 : Correlation coefficient between departure of the unskilled workers for foreign Employment and daily wages of Informal sector <> 0
